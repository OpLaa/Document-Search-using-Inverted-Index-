DATA COMMUNICATION
1MARK QUESTIONS
CHAPTER-1: INTRODUCTION
1.	Define Half Duplex.
In Half-Duplex each station can both transmit and receive but not at the same time. When one device is sending, other can only receive, and vice versa.
2.	Define Transit time.
Transit time is the amount of time required for a message to travel from one device to another.
3.	Define Response time.
Response time is the elapsed time between an enquiry and a response.
4.	What is meant by Frame?
Frame is data that is transmitted between network points as a unit with addressing and Protocol Control Information.
5.	Define Signalling.
It is the physical propagation of the signal along a suitable medium.
6.	List the Transmission Impairments.
i.	Attenuation
ii.	Delay Distortion
iii.	Noise 
7.	Define Noise.
Any undesired signals are referred to as noise.
8.	What is meant by Jitter?
Jitter refers to the variation in the packet arrival time.

1.	 Give some examples for Guided Transmission media.
Twisted pair, Coaxial cable and Optical fibre.
2.	Which is the least expensive Transmission media?
Twisted Pair is the least expensive Transmission media.
3.	What are the types of the Twisted Pair? 
Unshielded twisted pair and Shielded twisted pair.

5.	In Optical Fibre, the core has a diameter in the rate of 8 to 100 µm.
6.	Define Microwave Frequencies.
Frequencies which are in the range of about 1 GHz to 40 GHz are referred to as Microwave Frequencies.
7.	What do you mean by Antenna gain?
It is a measure of the directionality of an Antenna.
8.	Expand GPS.
Global Positioning System.
CHAPTER- 3: DATA ENCODING
1.	Define Polar Signalling.
In polar Signalling one logic state is represented by a positive voltage level and other by a negative voltage level. 
2.	What is Data signalling Rate?
This is the rate, data is transmitted in unit of bits per second (bps).
3.	What do you mean by ‘Duration of length of bit’?
It is the amount of time, a bit takes for transmission.
4.	Mention various Encoding techniques for conversion of Digital Data to Digital Signals.
i.	Non-Return to Zero (NRZ)
ii.	Multilevel Binary
iii.	Biphase
5.	Define Quantization.
Quantization is defined as the process of converting or representing the samples into digital form.
6.	Name the encoding type for Wireless Communication.
Spread Spectrum is an encoding form for Wireless Communication.
7.	Expand DSSS.
Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum.
8.	Expand CDMA.
Code Division Multiplexing Access. 
CHAPTER- 4: DATA LINK CONTROL
1.	List two types of parity check.
i.	Odd Parity
ii.	Even Parity.
2.	Expand ARQ.
Automatic Repeat Request.
3.	What is the function of Primary station in HDLC?
In HDLC Primary Station is responsible for controlling the operation of the link.
4.	 Mention various types of Data transfer Modes.
i.	Normal Response Mode (NRM)
ii.	Asynchronous Balanced Mode (ABM)
iii.	Asynchronous Response Mode (ARM).
5.	Expand FCS, NRM, ABM, ARM and CRC
FCS - Frame Check Sequence
NRM - Normal Response Mode
ABM - Asynchronous Balanced Mode
ARM - Asynchronous Response Mode
CRC- Cyclic Redundancy Check

6.	Define flow control.
Flow Control is a technique for assuring that a transmitting entity does not overcome a receiving entity.
7.	Expand RR, RNR, REJ and SREJ.
RR – Receiver Ready
RNR – Receiver Not Ready
REJ – Reject
SREJ – Selective Reject
8.	What is piggybacking?
Each data frame includes a field that holds the sequence number of the frame and a field that holds the sequence number used for acknowledgement.
CHAPTER- 5: MEDIUM ACCESS SUBLAYER 
1.	ALOHA was developed for Packet Radio Networks.
2.	What is meant by collision?
If the frames transmitted, interfere with each other at the receiver so that neither gets through then, it is said to be collision. 
3.	To improve efficiency, a modification of ALOHA known as Slotted ALOHA was developed.
CHAPTER- 6: MULTIPLEXING
1.	Define Multiplexing.
Multiplexing is the set of techniques that allows the simultaneous transmission of multiple signals across a single data link.
2.	Mention basic Multiplexing techniques.
i.	Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
ii.	Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)
iii.	Time Division Multiplexing  (TDM)
